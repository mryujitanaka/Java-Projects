<!-- About the Project -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F9D0 About the Project</strong></h2>
<p>This project is a kind of BIG folder where I keep all the documents related to my learning about Java. It is also a time capsule where I can always go back and review some content.</p>
<p>I believe that all knowledge on any subject should be shared with people. For that reason, I created this repository in order to be able to help the others. I hope this fulfills the purpose in some way.</p>
