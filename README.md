<!-- About the Project -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F9D0 About the Project</strong></h2>
    <p>This project is a kind of BIG folder where I keep all the documents related to my learning about Java. It is also a time capsule where I can always go back and review some content.</p>
    <p>I believe that all knowledge on any subject should be shared with people. For that reason, I created this repository in order to be able to help the others. I hope this fulfills the purpose in some way.</p>

<!-- Built With -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F6E0 Built With</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a></li>
    </ul>

<!-- Getting Started -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F3C1 Getting Started</strong></h2>
    <p>All projects in this repository were created via <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>. But if you use another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>, these projects will probably work for you. But you may need to make some changes to the files.</p>
    <p>To make the most of the content published here, you must have familiarity with Java.</p>
    <p>If you don't know Java, take the courses that are listed in the <a href="https://github.com/vyujitanaka/Java-Projects#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a> for this project.</p>

<!-- Prerequisites -->
### Prerequisites
All projects are organized in a numbered way (example: 1_ProjectNameOne, 2_ProjectName2, etc.).

All projects are organized in folders with the name of the course I took (example: 1_java-programming-masterclass-for-software-developers).

If you don't want to download an entire project, you can access the source code from a project by navigating to the "src" folder (without quotes).
